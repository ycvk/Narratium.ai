## 🧩 Why Narratium?

In the world of AI-powered interactive storytelling, common pain points include:

### SillyTavern

Powerful but overwhelming for beginners. Its complex setups, difficult card formats, and chaotic ecosystem can discourage new players before the adventure begins.

### AI Dungeon

Once a pioneer of infinite storytelling, it now erects walled gardens. Limited contexts, closed models, and lack of world customization restrict true ownership of adventures.

### Narratium changes everything.

We aim to make storytelling both simple and powerful:

* **Beginner-friendly**: Ready to play, intuitive interface, clear adventure, characters, and memory tracking.
* **Open & Extensible**: Open-source with support for any LLM, expandable characters, worlds, and memories.
* **Immersive & Consistent**: Focused on coherent storytelling, world logic, and character consistency, making every adventure a warm, personal, and traceable epic.
